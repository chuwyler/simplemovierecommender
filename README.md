# A Simple Cosine Similarity Based Movie Recommender

This repository contains a very simple cosine similarity-based movie
recommender for a linear algebra class I teach.

The app is based on flask, pandas and numpy. 
To run it, create a virtual environment with python==3.7.5 or similar and the requirements given in requirements.txt and then run `flask run` in the current directory. 
The app will then attach to a local port that you can access via web browser.

The movie ratings are taken from the <a

dataset</a> with movies up until 2018.

A running version of this application can be found on
[http://simplemovierecommender.pythonanywhere.com](http://simplemovierecommender.pythonanywhere.com).

This is just a simple demonstration that could profit from improvements on all ends! For questions and comments feel free to contact me via [cedric.huwyler@fhnw.ch](mailto:cedric.huwyler@fhnw.ch).
